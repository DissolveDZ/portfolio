							SpriteLight is my most recent game engine and I'm currently working on a rewrite in rust.
							This project was started around September of 2023.
							Using PBR and other modern
							rendering methods. It also features hot-reloading and highly abstracted drawing functions.
							The engine is also capable of rendering high-quality MSDF text on the gpu.
							It's running on a differed pipeline and is capable of physically-based bloom etc.
							<br><br>
							C-Engine on the other hand is my first game engine which was originally written in C
							and then rewritten using C++ using OOP syntax and most of what the language has to offer.

								This project, was started around the 15th of march 2023.
								In the image shown you can see about 31 million points being plotted in real-time.
								The basic idea involved making an optimized graph due to a rendering technique me and my brother
								developed.
								Technologies used include: Rust, OpenGL and SDL3.
								OpenGL was my choice due to it's level of control and how close it is to the hardware.
								This project also compiles to web and it is currently also possible to make it an IOS application.
